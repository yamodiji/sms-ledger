# Android SMS Permission Guide for SMS Ledger

## Understanding the "App was denied access" Message

If you're seeing a message like "App was denied access" or "Access to this permission can put your personal and financial info at risk", this is Android's **Restricted Settings** protection feature, introduced in Android 13+.

## Why This Happens

Android considers SMS reading a high-risk permission because:
- SMS messages often contain sensitive financial information
- Malicious apps could misuse this access
- Your bank transaction details need protection

## How to Fix This Issue

### Method 1: Enable Restricted Settings (Recommended)

1. **Open your phone's Settings app**
2. **Navigate to Apps** (may be called "Application Manager" or "App Management")
3. **Find "SMS Ledger"** in the app list
4. **Tap on SMS Ledger**
5. **Look for "More" or three-dot menu** and tap it
6. **Select "Allow restricted settings"**
7. **Follow the on-screen instructions** - Android will explain the risks
8. **Confirm that you trust this app**
9. **Go back and grant SMS permission**

### Method 2: Through App Permissions

1. **Open Settings → Apps → SMS Ledger**
2. **Tap "Permissions"**
3. **Find "SMS" permission**
4. **If you see a warning about restricted settings, tap "Allow"**
5. **Grant the SMS permission**

### Method 3: From the App

1. **Open SMS Ledger app**
2. **When you see the permission dialog, tap "Open Settings"**
3. **Follow the steps above**
4. **Return to the app and refresh**

## What Happens If You Don't Grant Permission?

- The app will work with **demo/sample data**
- You'll see example transactions from banks like HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis
- All features work normally, but with fake data
- You can still test the app's functionality

## Is It Safe to Grant SMS Permission?

**Yes, for SMS Ledger it's safe because:**

✅ **Open Source**: The code is publicly available on GitHub  
✅ **Local Processing**: SMS data is processed only on your device  
✅ **No Data Upload**: Your SMS messages never leave your phone  
✅ **Read-Only**: The app only reads SMS, never sends or modifies them  
✅ **Bank Focus**: Only looks for transaction-related messages  
✅ **Transparent**: You can see exactly what data is being used  

## Troubleshooting

### Still Can't Grant Permission?

1. **Restart your phone** and try again
2. **Clear SMS Ledger app data**:
   - Settings → Apps → SMS Ledger → Storage → Clear Data
3. **Reinstall the app**
4. **Check if your phone has additional security apps** that might be blocking permissions

### Permission Keeps Getting Revoked?

Some phones have aggressive battery optimization that revokes permissions:

1. **Settings → Battery → Battery Optimization**
2. **Find SMS Ledger and set to "Don't optimize"**
3. **Or add SMS Ledger to "Protected apps" list**

### Different Android Versions

**Android 13+**: Follow the restricted settings method above  
**Android 11-12**: Regular permission grant should work  
**Android 10 and below**: Standard permission dialog  

## Alternative Solutions

If you absolutely cannot grant SMS permission:

1. **Use the app with demo data** to test functionality
2. **Manually add transactions** (if we add this feature in future updates)
3. **Export bank statements** and import them (future feature)

## Privacy Assurance

**What SMS Ledger does:**
- Reads SMS messages locally on your device
- Identifies bank transaction messages using keywords
- Extracts amount, date, and bank information
- Displays this in a clean interface

**What SMS Ledger does NOT do:**
- Send your SMS data to any server

- Access non-financial SMS messages
- Share your data with third parties
- Require internet connection for SMS reading

## Need Help?
